A create a web management system for a medical practice which receptionists could use to upload doctor and patient information. I implemented PHP, MySQL and react from which I could validate, authenticate and upload information regarding the platform. The world we live in today is a world of big data and people have trouble finding meaningful patterns within the expanse of information we mine, collect and store. Therefore, as a data driven developer, I have taken over the role of implementing a real-world data driven web application using a Solar System API. Within the web application I utilised Charts.js, implemented my own unique form of data visualisation which relates to the theme of the data set and used REACT to construct my front end.

Website users are not aware (or do not care) that the information displayed originates from a database. Users simply want to search, post, or order. Therefore, this term we were required to create an interactive web application to manage an inventory. We were required to use Typescript to create the MEAN Stack application to track and craft new items.
